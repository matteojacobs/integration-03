        <img class="chapterI__image" src="/src/assets/temporary1.png" alt>
        <p class="chapterI__paragraph">The dim glow of candlelight flickered
          across the walls of a dimly lit room, casting long shadows that danced
          with the rhythm of the clacking wooden shoes outside. A hooded figure
          slipped quietly through the door, their footsteps muffled by the thick
          cobblestones that lined the narrow street.</p>
        <img class="chapterI__image" src="/src/assets/temporary2.png" alt>
        <p class="chapterI__paragraph">Inside, Christophe Plantin, sat among a
          circle of trusted associates. Their whispers filled the air, a
          symphony of secrecy and ambition, as they plotted a course that could
          alter history, or condemn them to a fate far worse than death.</p>
        <img class="chapterI__image" src="/src/assets/heroreplacement.png" alt>
        <p class="chapterI__paragraph">It was the 16th century, an era of
          religious fervor and political treachery. In the bustling heart of
          Antwerp, Christophe Plantin had carved out a name for himself as one
          of the most prominent printers of his time.</p>
        <p class="chapterI__paragraph">His reputation was a double-edged sword,
          a beacon of success that also made him a target for those who sought
          to quell the spread of forbidden ideas. The demand for Protestant
          literature was insatiable, yet the risk of printing such materials was
          perilous. The Inquisition's watchful eye was ever-present, ready to
          crush any whisper of dissent with the brutal efficiency of accusations
          of heresy.</p>

        <p class="chapterI__paragraph">Plantin's solution was as ingenious as it
          was dangerous. In the shadows of remote towns like Kampen, Vianen, and
          Wesel, he established secret printing presses, hidden sanctuaries
          where forbidden books could be produced and distributed discreetly
          among like-minded individuals. His network of friends and business
          partners was his armor, a carefully woven web of alliances that
          protected his illicit activities from the prying eyes of the
          authorities.</p>
